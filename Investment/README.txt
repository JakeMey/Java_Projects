The Investment program calculates and displays the future value of an investment over a specified number of years.

It prompts the user to enter the initial investment amount, the annual interest rate, and the duration in years.

Using these inputs, it computes the investment value at the end of each year, applying compound interest, and prints a formatted table showing the year, initial amount, interest rate, and calculated value for each year.
