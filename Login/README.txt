The program Login is a simple login system that prompts the user for a username and password.

It checks the input against two valid combinations: "Rose" with "Red" and "Violet" with "Blue."

Based on the input, it either confirms a successful login, indicates suspended access for incorrect passwords, or denies access if the username is not recognized.

It uses the Scanner class for input and if-else statements for validation.
