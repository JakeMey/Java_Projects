The Payroll program calculates an employee's net pay based on their hours worked, hourly rate, and tax rates.

It collects the employee's name, hours worked, pay rate, and tax rates as input.

The program then calculates the gross pay, tax amounts, and net pay before displaying the employee's details, gross pay, deductions, and net pay.
